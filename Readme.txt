		Detector Pile-up
=======================================================
Introduction : 
One of the common problems in gamma-ray spectroscopy is
 the pile up of pulses as they are incident on a
 radiation detector. Pulses from a radiation detector are
 randomly spaced in time and can lead to interfering
 effects between them when counting rates are high. This
 occurs when two pulses are sufficiently close together in
 time so that they are treated as single pulse by the
 analysis system. The superposition of pulses will lead
 to a combined pulse with apparent amplitude equal to the
 sum of the individual amplitudes. This is called pulse 
pileup and can cause considerable distortion in the
 resulting spectrum. 
Case Study: 
A Cs-137 source is placed in front of a detector at variable
 distances.
 Input
1) The Cs-137 total spectrum (without pileup).
 The file name is Cs137.txt 2) 
The background spectrum.
 The filename is background.txt 
Output
Piled-up spectra at various count rates
